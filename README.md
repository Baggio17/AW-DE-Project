## Adventure Works Data Engineering-Project
1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of core data engineering concepts using Microsoft Azure’s ecosystem. The project’s primary focus is on building a comprehensive data pipeline that collects, transforms, and visualizes data using a Medallion architecture, comprising bronze, silver, and gold layers.

This project integrates several Azure tools, including Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI, to ensure seamless data processing and reporting. The project uses the Adventure Works dataset as the primary data source, showcasing its real-world applicability.

2. Project Importance
- Practical Skill Development: The project provides hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and technologies, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
- Data Engineering Best Practices: It incorporates essential data engineering practices such as dynamic pipelines, role-based access management, and efficient data transformation.
- Business Insights: The final phase of the project demonstrates how data engineering facilitates actionable insights for decision-makers through data visualization.

3. Tools and Technologies Used
- Azure Portal: For setting up the environment, creating resource groups, and managing services.
- Azure Blob Storage & Data Lake: To store raw and processed data.
- Azure Data Factory (ADF): For creating dynamic data pipelines to move and transform data.
- Azure Databricks: For advanced data transformations using PySpark.
- Azure Synapse Analytics: To integrate data lakes with SQL-based queries and manage data warehouses.
- Power BI: For creating data visualizations and dashboards.
- Adventure Works Dataset: As the data source for the project.

4. Project Steps
Phase 1: Setting Up the Azure Environment
- Setting Up Resources: Created a Resource Group and provisioned Azure Blob Storage, Data Lake, and Azure Data Factory.
  
- Data Upload to GitHub: Uploaded the Adventure Works dataset to a GitHub repository to enable version control and easy access.
